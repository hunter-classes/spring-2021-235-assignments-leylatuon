* Last name: Tuon Cao

* First name: Leyla

* Notes:
- For the midterm assignment I started the list without beginning with an empty header node and I tweaked the rotation position changing it from 5 to 4 to adjust for this while
getting the same intended results



* General instructions:
- Fill in your name and GitHub username on top.
- Make a folder and add files for each small assignment
